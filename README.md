# chromeOS-exploits
A repo with loads of my favorite chromeOS exploits for your chromebook!


The code is just a couple of bookmarklets for school.

Here are some REAL hacks!:
1. sh1mmer.me PATCHED ON ChromeOS 111
2. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tl8eP26MFRejHO38H5HwMLl2VaQrtn0Z/preview This iss SKOVIOX. To browse freely.
3. Here are some steps to browse google without restrictions ;) STEP 1: On your chromebooks sign in screen click "add person".
STEP 2: When clicked press "sign in options" then "sign in with github". STEP 3: At the bottom press "terms" and then press the github logo. go to the trending repositories. STEP 3: Find google, in that repo click the link to google.com. UNRESTRICTED BROWSING!
DISCLAIMER: This may not work for everyone. I. DONT. GIVE. A. SHIT. don't create an issue.
4. INSANE DISCLAIMER :O The ESC-REFRESH-POWER trick was patched. Also, On the new Asus laptops you cannot take out the EE chip.
THESE ARE THE ONLY WAYS TO EXPLOIT YOUR ADMINS.
Maybe your board is different but mine is smart. They block inspect on hacking pages and block most settings.

I will update soon.
